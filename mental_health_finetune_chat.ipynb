Sometimes more physical activities, such as doing a few jumping jacks, can be helpful. If you don't exercise, it might be something to talk with your doctor about first.The more you can learn about what makes you want to cut, the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that.

Do you want to pray about it? Do you want to read and research books about trauma? Take some time and think about what you want to do. Think about what would work for you and dive in. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, so I am biased - but I really believe that counseling works. Having an objective, professional voice that can guide you on this process is so valuable.

You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own, or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation. \\u00a0 One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is, \\\"The Assertiveness Workbook: How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships\\\" by Randy J Paterson.\",\n          \"If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse. \\u00a0They should be told for their own empowerment.

Being bisexual can be particularly\\ndifficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are \\u201csupposed\\u201d\\nto be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so\\noften that there is actually a term for it \\u2013\\u00a0\\nbi-erasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that\\nbisexuality is a real thing, or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs\\nlike your parents seem to have. \\nThe unfortunate truth is that you can never\\nbe sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds\\npromising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it may\\nsimply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate\\ninformation, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. \\nSome of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some more\\u00a0things that you can consider\\nand questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them:\\n\\u00a0\\n1.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 If they don\\u2019t respond the way you want them to, have you developed a support\\nsystem to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all\\nthe friends in the world won\\u2019t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don\\u2019t\\nrespond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE\\nokay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember. \\n\\u00a0\\n2.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can\\noffer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for\\nthem to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young\\npeople because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from\\nGLAAD about bi-erasure: http://www.glaad.org/bisexual/bierasure\\n\\u00a0\\n3.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take\\nplace when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media,\\nand even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are\\nready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, don\\u2019t\\nfeel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out\\non your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand\\nthis. \\n\\u00a0\\n4.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just\\nbecause someone is LGBTQ doesn\\u2019t mean that they necessarily want to be. Many\\npeople struggle with this. Having\\nyour own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are\\nin telling your parents. So, perhaps do some self-exploration about your\\nfeelings toward yourself. \\n\\u00a0\\nSometimes people take friends with them\\nwhen they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want\\nto consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If\\nyour parents don\\u2019t respond well, that doesn\\u2019t mean that they never will. Some\\nstart off upset, but then work their way through it. \\nBest of luck to you. \\nRobin J.
